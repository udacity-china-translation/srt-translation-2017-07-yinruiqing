00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,580
So let's get started with programming, and programming is really the core computer science.

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:08,036
Most machines are designed to do just one thing.

3
00:00:08,698 --> 00:00:14,265
This is supposed to be a toaster, more of a representational drawing than an accurate one.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,736
And a toaster, we can do more than one thing with a toaster.

5
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:26,488
We can put different things in it. We can toast bread, we can toast muffins, maybe it has some things we can use to change its behavior a little bit.

6
00:00:26,745 --> 00:00:30,376
We can turn a setting to make it toast for longer or shorter.

7
00:00:30,376 --> 00:00:36,666
But it's pretty limited in what it can do. Everything it can do is a variation on this basic functionality that it was designed for:

8
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:42,812
this basic process of putting toast in, heating it up and getting the toast to pop out.

9
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:48,371
If we want to change its behavior to do something really different, we'd have to physically alter the machine.

10
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,536
We could maybe take the parts out, and put them together in a new way.

11
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:56,713
If we're really creative we could make a bicycle from the toaster. That would be a pretty big project, though.

12
00:00:57,368 --> 00:01:00,848
So without a program a computer is even less useful than a toaster.

13
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:02,600
You can't do anything without a program.

14
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:04,918
The program is what tells the computer what to do.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:12,278
And the power of the computer, is that, unlike a toaster, which is only designed to do a few things, a computer can do anything.

16
00:01:12,679 --> 00:01:17,494
A computer is a universal machine. We can program it to do essentially any computation.

17
00:01:18,076 --> 00:01:23,428
So anything that we can imagine, anything that we can figure out how to write a program for, we can make the computer do.

18
00:01:24,032 --> 00:01:27,053
And what the program needs to be is a very precise sequence of steps.

19
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,648
The computer by itself doesn't know how to do anything. It has a few simple instructions that it can execute.

20
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:38,683
And to make a program do something useful we need to put those instructions together in a way that it does what we want.

21
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:47,574
So we can turn the computer into a web browser, into a server, into a game-playing machine, into a toaster, without anywhere to put the bread.

22
00:01:47,956 --> 00:01:52,011
But it can do anything we can imagine: at least any computation we want to do.

23
00:01:52,853 --> 00:01:56,603
The power of the computer is that it can execute the steps super super fast.

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,706
So we can execute billions of instructions in one second.

25
00:02:00,389 --> 00:02:04,458
The program gives us a way to tell the computer what steps to take.

26
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:07,456
So there are many different languages for programming computers.

27
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:14,042
The language we are going to learn in this course is the language called Python, like the snake. It is also named after Monty Python.

28
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:19,803
The important thing about Python is that it gives us a nice high-level language that we can use to write programs.

29
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:28,001
And that means instead of our program running directly on the computer, the programs we write will be an input to the Python program which runs on the computer.

30
00:02:28,491 --> 00:02:33,545
What Python is is called an interpreter. That means it runs our programs, it interprets them, 

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,545
executes the programs that we wrote in Python language by running a program in a language into the computer can understand directly.
